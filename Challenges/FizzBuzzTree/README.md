# Fizz Buzz Tree
Fizz Buzz is an old drinking game and a favorite challenge of computer science people everywhere. Bring out a metronome, at each beat of the metronome, count up "1, 2 ...". The trick is, for each number divisible by three, replace it with 'Fizz'. Divisible by 5, replace with 'Buzz'. Divisible by both, replace with 'FizzBuzz'. Continue until someone gets it wrong and has to drink.
ex: "1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz, 16 ..."
