# Max Heap
A max heap is a binary tree that always has the maximum value on top.

This implementation of a Max heap has four pulbic methods:
1) the constructor: either a defaut construtor or pass it an array of ints and it will construct a heap
2) ToArray() will return the current heap in an array
3) CompareToArray(int[] arr) will compare the current heap against the heap that would be generated by that array
4) Heapify(node) will check if the node in question violates the max heap property. If it does, it will correct the error recurrsively until, eventually, the max heap property is restored. This assumes all child trees.
