# Binary Trees
A binary tree is a data structure. In short, each node has a value and up to two children - a left and a right. The node at the top is the root, and from the root you can navigate down to any node you desire.
## example
```
		|6|  -- The root node has a value of 6 and two children
		/ \
	  |5| |300|
	 /    /   \
   |-5| |25|  |443|
```
In the above example, the node that contains 6 is the root of the tree. Its left child has a node with value 5, its right has a node of value 300. The node of value 5 has only one child, which is its left child.
