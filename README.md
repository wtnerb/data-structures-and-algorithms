# data-structures-and-algorithms
Solving data structure and algorithm problems. Some required, some for fun.

## Organization
The structure of this folder is algorithms in the Algorithm folder, Data Structures and the basic manipulations thereof in their own folder. Each structure or algorithm should have its own folder and feature branch with matching names. Each structure or algorithm will have its own readme in its folder. Each new feature added will have its own folder and readme. This project is largely a learning excercise, as well as putting my own "notes" online.
